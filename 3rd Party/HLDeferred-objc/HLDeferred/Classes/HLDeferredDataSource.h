// This NSOperation will be added to and retained by the queue, so it is
// safe to release this operation after calling this method.
// Note: the returned HLDeferred is retained by this operation, so you
// are not required to retain the returned HLDeferred to ensure it and its
// callbacks survive until the operation is complete.
//
// Note that this method returns an HLDeferred and the name of the method
// starts with "request". This is a coding convention we suggest you follow:
// "The name of methods returning (HLDeferred *) should start with request"
- (HLDeferred *) requestStartOnQueue: (NSOperationQueue *)queue;

// sends -takeResult: to the HLDeferred, on the main thread using dispatch_async
// the result is from [self result], so call -setResult: before you call this
- (void) asyncCompleteOperationResult;

// sends -takeError: to the HLDeferred, on the main thread using dispatch_async
// the error is from [self error], so call -setError: before you call this

// Override this and do what you need to do.
// The default implementation does nothing.
// Your execute method should:
// - call -setResult: then -asyncCompleteOperationResult
// or
// - call -setError: then -asyncCompleteOperationError
// DO NOT CALL THIS YOURSELF

// Optionally override this
// Called after the HLDeferred's callback chain has run.
// DO NOT CALL THIS YOURSELF except to call super, which
// you MUST do if you override this
